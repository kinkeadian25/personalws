      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p><em>I am an aspiring Software Engineer, working towards <strong><a href="https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/">MSSA</a></strong> acceptance.</em></p>
      <p>After 6 years in the Navy, I am now working towards my dream of being a software engineer
        who is committed to permanent personal growth and collaboration with brilliant individuals.</p>
      <p>During my time as an active duty sailor, I worked as a seasoned communicator and PAO,
        who operated under strict and necessary mission timelines to provide expeditionary
        public affairs support to Navy commands all across the world. I have learned the necessary
        skills to communicate with internal and external audiences through multiple mediums,
        including social media campaigns, videos filmed and edited by myself, graphic designs,
        print stories, and photography. The Navy not only taught me how to takes orders,
        but it also permitted me to step into leadership roles from an early age, and I have
        found that I thrive most in my professional life when given the ability to not only lead
        but to mentor and promote the skills of my peers and employees.</p>
